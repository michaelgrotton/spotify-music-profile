# spotify-music-profile
React/express app to implement some cool features with the spotify api

I am having some trouble deploying it on heroku right now so this is just the source code with some screenshots below.
You can log into your spotify account, then see your personal data on tracks and artists.

If you'd like to run this locally:
  * download the files
  * cd into client, run ```npm install```, then run ```npm start```
  * cd into auth-server run ```npm install```, then run ```node authorization_code/app.js```
  * got to ```localhost:3000``` in your browser
